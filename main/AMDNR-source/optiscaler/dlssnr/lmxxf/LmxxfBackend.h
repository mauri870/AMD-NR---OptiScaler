// The lmxxf neural backend: hosts lmxxf's open-source DLSS 5 runtime (dlssnr/lmxxf/runtime,
// built as LmxxfNrRuntime.dll) behind the same interface the bridge uses for danielblnc's.
//
// How it fits the frame (the whole design, in one place):
//
//   frame N, pre-SR, on the game's command list:
//     1. consume frame N-1's answer: the runtime decodes it (RecordOutputs; the D3D12 queue wait
//        on the HIP result is issued right there, before this list runs) and a small shader
//        writes  edit = answer - what the network was fed  into the temporal pass's residual
//        history, still in frame N-1's pixel space;
//     2. copy this frame's colour to FP16 (and to the model's size when that differs);
//     3. hand that copy to the runtime (PrepareFrame + RecordInputs);
//     4. the temporal pass (preset 9) carries the edit onto THIS frame by motion and jitter,
//        fades it where the geometry changed, adds it to the raw colour: that is the upscaler's
//        input.
//   when the game submits that list: EnqueueHipAsync - HIP waits for the list on the GPU, runs
//   the network, signals. Nothing on the queue waits for it until step 1 of the next frame.
//
// So the network never stalls the frame that fed it, and the game's list is never split. The
// price is one frame of latency on the model's edit, paid by reprojecting the edit rather than
// a picture, which is what the interleave presets already do on their skipped frames.
//
// Colour composition ([DlssNr] AmdComposition). Classic (0) is exactly the above: the runtime
// composes its answer at Detail / Colour strength. RenoDX (1, experimental): step 3 asks the
// runtime for strengths 1/1, latched per job, so its decode hands back RenoDX's `upgraded`;
// step 1 then composes that against what the network was fed (dlssnr/amd/NrCompose.h, the tail
// danielblnc's runtime runs too; W = 1 in fed units) and the edit becomes (composed - fed) / e.
// Refused - Classic, one log line and a menu note - for Network output, display-referred colour,
// final image mode and the runtime's DLSS5_CODEC_SRGB / DLSS5_DEBUG_TINT overrides.
//
// Highlight colour (0.3.3, host-side; the runtime is untouched; the guard and the cap below are
// both off by default in 0.3.3, the self-heal is on). In step 1, where the copy the
// network was fed passed the codec's shoulder (max channel above 0.75, fully from 1.5), the
// answer keeps its light and takes the raw frame's colour, in both compositions ([DlssNr]
// AmdLmxxfHighlightChromaGuard, LmxxfBackend.cpp's ResidualShader): the shoulder squashes such a
// pixel toward white and the decode would hand it back grey. Auto-exposure stops raising the
// exposure while over 8% of the frame is fed past 0.75 ([DlssNr] AmdLmxxfAutoExposureHighlightCap,
// AutoExposureHlsl.h), and a title exposure that blows the feed out is replaced by auto-exposure
// (the self-heal, now also at exposure 1).
