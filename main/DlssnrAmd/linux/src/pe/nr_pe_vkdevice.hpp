// Watching a Vulkan game create its device, so the three Vulkan paths do not
// each have to ask their upscaler for handles the upscaler may not carry.
//
// The two D3D runtimes have an interop object that hands over the instance, the
// physical device, the device and a submittable queue. A Vulkan game has nothing
// of the sort: NGX's init passes the handles but no queue, the ffx-api's Vulkan
// backend passes them only at context creation, and XeSS passes none of them at
// dispatch. All three can be served from one place - the game's own
// `vkCreateDevice` and `vkGetDeviceQueue` - and then no Vulkan path depends on
// which upscaler happened to fire.
//
// The queue matters and is not a detail: building the network uploads its
// weights, which is a submit. Without a queue the Vulkan paths can record
// nothing at all.
